# Enhancing-Automation-Through-Smart-Systems
This thesis presents a comprehensive study on addressing key issues in smart home environments, with a focus on enhancing security, efficiency, and ease of use. The research project involved the implementation of various features and technologies to overcome these challenges. Firstly, gas level warnings and front door entry monitoring were integrated to ensure heightened security. Real-time alerts were provided for raised gas levels, while a smart door lock system facilitated secure access control. 

Secondly, to improve energy efficiency, an automated thermostat control system was developed. This system autonomously adjusted temperature settings based on sensor readings, minimizing energy wastage and promoting environmentally friendly practices. Furthermore, to facilitate ease of use, particularly for disabled individuals, a user-friendly web application with an interactive UI was developed. This application enabled remote control of lights and thermostat settings, empowering users to customize their living environment through an accessible platform. 

We have demonstrated the successful resolution of security, efficiency, and ease of use issues in our smart home project through the Results chapter. The implementation of gas level warnings and front door entry monitoring enhances security measures, while the automated thermostat control ensures energy efficiency. Additionally, the user-friendly web application with an interactive UI offers enhanced accessibility and ease of use, particularly benefiting disabled individuals. Overall, our smart home project effectively addresses these critical concerns, making homes safer, more efficient, and more user-friendly, enhancing the overall quality of residential living.
